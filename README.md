* I'm interested in Deep learning, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.

I am currently working on upgrading the softmax formula used in Attention in collaboration with a researcher. 
I am also Fine-tuning Flan-T5 as part of PatternAnalysis2025.

If that's something you are passionate as well then reach out, maybe we could work on a project!
